# adsbMonitor
This project originally started life as an Android application to monitor a Dump1090-Mutability instance. (If you don't know what Dump1090-Mutability is, then this app may not be for you!).  After playing about with the Dump1090-Mutability REST API, I decided that there were better ways to get the monitoring data rather than using an app.

Therefore I have decided to use the app to get data from Dump1090 to provide info about flights etc.  This is a good way to also try out different stuff in an Android app.

To use this app you must have an instance of Dump1090-Mutability (must be the Mutability version rather than any other version, as this provides an API to get the required data) running on your network, more than likely on a Raspberry Pi 

Initially the app will just display received flights, but there is more functionality I want to add whenever I get the time.

Currently a work in progress so not fully functional
